## Strategy
- Before the mains I spent most (I would say almost 90%) of my time on maths, since I felt I had a good idea on how to write GS answers.
- While solving maths questions my aim was always to arrive at the answer without any silly mistakes. Silly mistakes cost dearly.


## Resources for Mathematics
The idea was to pickup sources which were easier to read and understand.
