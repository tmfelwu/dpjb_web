Essay and ethics can be scoring based on previous marks allocation. Writing essay

Of all the tests I took during the prep, the most helpful had been the online mentorship from Navya Mam for Essay Tests. I distinctly recall the valuable experience of engaging in mentor calls after each essay, where I had the opportunity to discuss my work with Mam. These discussions went beyond simply pointing out areas for improvement; they also highlighted the strengths in my writing. One aspect that made this mentorship particularly effective was the emphasis on fostering a two-way discussion rather than just receiving written comments.  This approach not only gives you feedback, but you can also discuss the rationale behind the feedback received. This approach allowed for a deeper exploration of my essays. I am grateful for the mentorship and consider it instrumental in my essay preparation journey.
