## Basics and Groups



### 

Let $m_{1}, m_{2}, \cdots, m_{k}$ be positive integers and $d>0$ the greatest common divisor of $m_{1}, m_{2}, \cdots, m_{k}$. Show that there exist integers $x_{1}, x_{2}, \cdots, x_{k}$ such that

$$
d=x_{1} m_{1}+x_{2} m_{2}+\cdots+x_{k} m_{k}
$$

### 2a 2019

If $G$ and $H$ are finite groups whose orders are relatively prime, then prove that there is only one homomorphism from $G$ to $H$, the trivial one.

### 2a 2018

Show that the quotient group of $(\mathbb{R},+)$ modulo $\mathbb{Z}$ is isomorphic to the multiplicative group of complex numbers on the unit circle in the complex plane. Here $\mathbb{R}$ is the set of real numbers and $\mathbb{Z}$ is the set of integers.

### 2a 2010

Let $\left(\mathbb{R}^{*}\right.$, $)$ be the multiplicative group of nonzero reals and $(G L(n, \mathbb{R}), X)$ be the multiplicative group of $n \times n$ non-singular' real matrices. Show that the quotient group $G L(n, \mathbb{R}) / S L(n, \mathbb{R})$ and $\left(\mathbb{R}^{*}, \cdot\right)$ are isomorphic where

$S L(n, \mathbb{I})=\{A \in G L(n, \mathbb{I R}) / \operatorname{det} A=1\}$.

### 1a 2009

If $\mathbb{R}$ is the set of real numbers and $\mathbb{R}_{+}$is the set of positive real numbers, show that $\mathbb{R}$ under addition $(\mathbb{R},+)$ and $\mathbb{R}$, under multiplication $\left(\mathbb{R}_{+}, \cdot\right)$ are isomorphic. Similarly if $\mathbb{Q}$ is the set of rational numbers and $Q_{+}$the set of positive rational numbers, are $(\mathbb{Q},+)$ and $\left(\mathbb{Q}_{+}, \cdot\right)$ isomorphric? Justify your answer. $4+8=12$
